# W_Secure

This project is a mix of two things, one is android app with security features like location sharing, helpline calling and video recording that'll be stored on the web so that it cannot be tampered (no redirection to the camera to maintain low profile during the whole recording). Marking of the Safe Spaces near the person and the features like SOS buttons that sends live locations to emergency contact also the a block that hinders the phone getting switched off.

Second being 3 AI models that can be implemented in CCTV cameras to detect women in distress by analyzing the number to men following one women and by recognizing gestures(timid, running).
